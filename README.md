# 100daysofML
In this repository, I pledge to code ML task for at least an hour every day in 100 days

In every next day from 9th July up to 100 days count I dedicate 1 hour of ML codinng. As a learner,most of my coding however will
be programming along different instructors from their video tutorial mostly Raj, Sentdex, Deeplizard and but not limited to Data School.
While doing this, probably by 25th day I will start my own Project, during this time while programming along I wouldlike to put my skills into practice, I am expecting to work on a recent datasent of image-character recognition called "TOTALTeXTs": I can't wait to get enough skills and accomplish my own project. The reason I am so interested with this project is that it really brings new challenge in OCR research to consider multi-orientational character detection such as curves and other regular geometrical oriented text in images. I will really appreciate any contribution regarding this project. I will really appreciate people with similar interest who want join, learn together and finally put some landmark in this area. 
let's do this people
